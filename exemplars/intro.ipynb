    "The vertical exemplars each illustrate a path to take in order to process data from beginning to end. As such, the user may use them as models to run their own processing by replacing the values of certain parameters with their own values. To facilitate this, the names of all objects made in the exemplars begin with ```u_``` (short for 'user'; e.g., ```u_datapoints```) and may be changed to names of the user's choosing. There is limited technical information in these exemplars, however the user may refer to the horizontal exemplars and the User Manual for more details.\n",

These exemplars are _not_ intended to be used as models for the user to run their own processing."

The path to the folder containing these files should then be set with the ```input_folder``` parameter at the start of each exemplar."
