# thinst: sample survey data

## Description
The ```sampley``` package serves to sample survey data (hence 'sampley'; sample + survey). By 'survey data', we refer 
principally to systematic visual survey data, nevertheless, the ```sampley``` package may also be applicable to other 
kinds of survey data. By 'sample', we mean process those data to produce distinct samples that can then be input to a 
model.
